# Memoize - A Flashcard Creator

## Description

Memoize is project 4 of my fellowship with Headstarters. This application uses OpenAI which is given a System Prompt to use specific search parameters. Users can log on using Next Auth's Google Provider, create 12 flashcards at a time by simply typing in what subject they are wanting to study, save the sets to a Firestore Database, and (soon to come), pay for 1 of 3 plans offered on a 3 tiered platform. Payments will be accepted through the Stripe Software. As of now Stripe is loaded and functioning in a development environment.

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Poppins, a custom Google Font.
